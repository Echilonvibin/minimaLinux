## 🗑️ Uninstallation

If you need to revert the changes and restore your system to its previous state (using the backup files created during installation), follow these steps.

### Step 1: Run the Uninstallation Script

Navigate to the repository directory if you are not already there, grant execution permissions, and execute the uninstallation script:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
